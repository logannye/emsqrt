# Join pipeline example
# Demonstrates joining two data sources

# Note: Join pipelines require two separate scan steps
# This is a simplified example - full join support may require additional YAML syntax
steps:
  - op: scan
    source: "data/orders.csv"
    schema:
      - name: "order_id"
        type: "Int64"
        nullable: false
      - name: "customer_id"
        type: "Int64"
        nullable: false
      - name: "total"
        type: "Float64"
        nullable: false

  - op: project
    columns:
      - "order_id"
      - "customer_id"
      - "total"

  - op: sink
    destination: "output/orders.csv"
